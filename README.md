# litmus-ansible

This repo consists of Litmus Chaos Experiments written as ansible playbooks. The examples in this repo are good indicators 
of how to construct the experiments in ansible: complete with steady state checks, chaosresult generation, chaos injection,
post chaos checks, event & and reports generation etc.,   

**NOTE**

- litmus-ansible is very similar in purpose to and therefore a sister repo of [litmus-python](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-python) & [litmus-go](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-go) which contain experiment business logic written in python & golang respectively.
